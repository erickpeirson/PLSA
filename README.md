This is a PLSA (Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis) implementation for large corpora
using the EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm and multiprocessing.

When modeling large corpora, memory consumption can become a severe bottleneck. This 
project addresses that problem by using PyTables.

## Requirements
* [Python 2.7](http://www.python.org/)
* PyTables
* Numpy
